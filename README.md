In this study, a recently developed normalization method was  employed to capture the heterogeneity of colon cancer cells. By analyzing gene expression through RNA-seq, this method identifies molecular variations in tumor progression from early to late stage . Hierarchical clustering was subsequently  applied to visualize clusters with distinct progression patterns, enabling the sub-classification of heterogeneous colon cancer into newly identified molecular subtypes. The research also examines differentially expressed genes, mutational variation, the tumor microenvironment, and pathways across subtypes. Further analysis of DEGs for optimal subset genes within the cancer clusters was also explored to refine subtype characterization.
